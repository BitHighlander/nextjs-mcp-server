# MCP Integration Issues and Troubleshooting

## Current State
We've successfully created an MCP server with a stateful house exploration mini-game that demonstrates:
1. Persistent state between requests
2. Navigation between locations
3. Item collection and inventory management
4. Key and password protection

## Connection Status
- The MCP server is running on `http://localhost:3001`
- Cursor is successfully establishing SSE connections to the server (as shown in the logs)
- Cursor is refreshing the tools list from our server

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Tools Not Displaying
Despite successful connections, the tools defined in our MCP server are not showing up in the Cursor interface.

### 2. No `/mcp/spec` Requests
Our server logs show multiple SSE connections to the root endpoint (`/`), but we don't see any requests to `/mcp/spec` where Cursor would fetch the available methods.

### 3. Format Compatibility
We've tried multiple formats for the `/mcp/spec` endpoint:
- Using a `tools` array with method details
- Using a `methods` array with a `metadata` object
- Using a flat `methods` object with descriptions

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Check Cursor MCP Version
Cursor might be using a specific version of the MCP protocol. We should verify which version it expects.

### 2. Inspect Network Requests
Using browser developer tools to inspect what requests Cursor is making to other working MCP servers might reveal the expected format.

### 3. Try Different Configuration
The issue might be with how we've registered the MCP server in Cursor's configuration. We should:
- Verify the format in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- Try using a command-based configuration instead of a URL

### 4. Additional Endpoints
Some MCP implementations might require additional endpoints beyond the standard ones. We could add:
- `/jsonrpc` endpoint
- WebSocket support

## Next Steps
1. Test with a simpler MCP server implementation
2. Compare with known working MCP servers
3. Verify if any headers or other metadata are required in responses
4. Test with specific Cursor versions
